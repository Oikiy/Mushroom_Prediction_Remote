## This is a notebook for the project: "Mushroom Prediction"


This is one of the 2024 playground competitions on Kaggle. 

The major goal of the project is to develope a classifier for classifying muchrooms into edible or poisonous based on physical characteristics presented in tabulated formats. 
The performance of the model will be assessed by the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), that is calculated by:

$$MCC = \frac{TP \cdot TN - FP \cdot FN}{\sqrt{(TP + FP)(TP + FN)(TN + FP)(TN + FN)}}$$
